# Azure SOC Honeypot & Sentinel Project
Security Operations Center (SOC) project using Azure VM, Sentinel, KQL, and geoIP enrichment.


This project simulates a real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) experience using Azure. It includes:
- Setting up a honeypot with an exposed VM
- Log analysis using Event Viewer and Sentinel
- KQL queries to investigate attacks
- IP-to-Geo enrichment using Watchlists
- Visualization of attacker location using Sentinel Workbooks

## What You'll Learn
- Azure VM deployment
- Windows Security Event logging
- KQL for log investigation
- Watchlist integration in Sentinel
- Visualizing attack sources on a map

## Project Steps
1. Azure Subscription Setup
2. Deploying a Windows Honeypot VM
3. Logging & Event Viewer
4. Sentinel Log Analytics + KQL
5. Enriching logs with GeoIP
6. Visualizing Attacks on a Map
